* added file GG_Gelegenheitsdichtung_Trauer_Hamburg_1652.txt
* file was converted from .rtf to .txt manually
* \ as marker for line break was removed automatically
* seems to be transcription errors in file, must be proof read
* added file GG_Gelegenheitsdichtung_Weihnachtgedancken Zweidruck_1639.txt
* added file GG_Gelegenheitsgedicht_Hochzeit_1643.txt
* both were automatically converted from .rtf to .txt with TextEdit
* both need checking for spelling and overall transcription quality
* added Kasualgedicht_GG_1638_Johann Georg Herzog zu Sachsen.txt
* file was automatically converted from .doc to .txt using MS word, encoding UTF-8
* experimented with using OxGarage for conversion directly to TEI P5 but didn't yield the expected result, probably bc. too little layout information in the original .doc file
* file needs proof reading and check of transcription quality
* added file Ethica 1728_2017-10-12.txt
* automatically converted from .docx to .txt using MS Word
* was unexpectedly complete transcription of 1728 edition of Ethica
* conversion incomplete, comments and highlights weren't taken with
* since it is in almost finial stage, it should be considered for publication on DTA soon
* two .docx files Ethica 1728_2017-10-03.docx and Ethica 1728_2017-10-12.docx for same 1728 edition were uploaded to repository for proofing, will be deleted afterwards
* changed folder structure in repository, moved all Ethica related transcriptions into individual folders for each edition
* general deliberation: should .docx and similar files be put in GitHub repo?
* pro: everything related to the project is kept in the same place
* contra: .docx etc. don't version control; it's also a lot of files bc. of manual 'versioning'
* contra: it looks messy and isn't necessarily useful to anyone
* solution? only put final version there in a versionable format (.txt or .xml)
* store other versions (historical versions) in local folder for archiving?
